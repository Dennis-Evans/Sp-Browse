# Sp-Browse
derived browse class to load a file loaded browse from a stored procedure

A base class for a clarion browse to use a stored procedure for the loading of a file-loaded browse.

The code currently contains just the code to do the read.  Code for an update procedure and a page loaded browse will eventually be added.

this should be considered a community project so anyone can add code, fix errors, ...

SOme template code could be useful but this should be keep in derived objects for the most part.  Possiably a template that collects 
the stored proecure name and parameters, if any, could be added.
